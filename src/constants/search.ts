                As a passionate 22-year-old tech entrepreneur, I am a Computer Science student at IIITD, a self-taught Web/ App Developer, Game Developer, Author, Instructor, and a Podcast Creator/Host. 
                I've sharpened my freelancing skills through diverse projects, leveraging skills like Web-Development, App Development, Game Development and Full Stack Development. I co-founded Simply Sites, now Wexus.in, enhancing my project management and client communication abilities.
                With several published games via Unity (available on Google Playstore) and two books on Amazon, I demonstrate my creativity and articulate communication.
                As an Instructor at AccioJob, I've educated 90k+ students across various platforms including Youtube. I was also one of the first teen brand ambassadors for www.fampay.in. 
                I'm open to networking and new opportunities, so feel free to connect!
